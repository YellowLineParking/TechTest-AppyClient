# Mobile / Front End Developer Test

In this test, we would like you to bulid a mobile/web application to display our parking data.

We have provided a set of [user stories](/UserStories.md) to help guide you on the requirements. We recommend that you work through them in order.

You may use your own creative judgement to design the application. We have provided some [assets](/Assets) for you to use as you wish.

We do not expect you to build any registration flow. In order to create an account, you should download our AppyParking app, and sign up with a username and password or use the AppyParking web app.

# Technical Requirements

The application should support logging in using oAuth, and displaying parking information on a map.

To obtain parking data for pins and zones, you should use our parking api. We have supplied a [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection [here](/ApiDocs) to help you interrogate our API.

You should use Google Maps to display map data.
